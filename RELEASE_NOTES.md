# Harklight Server v0.1.31

## Changes

- Device revocation ends every origin session from that device with the
  existing gone availability.
- Enrolled devices can read and update their access levels. Updates emit
  connection-local synchronization hints, and operation receipts are durable.
- Relay timeout and outcome-unknown snapshots are bounded and recorded outside
  the request path.
- Push-dispatcher crash/status output omits cached APNs tokens.
- The Bandit dependency is updated to 1.14.0.
- Release publication does not trigger installation. Installation is available
  only through an explicitly authorized manual workflow dispatch.
- Configurable score-based priority levels, unseen-message advisories, and
  closed-chat behavior remain available.
- The server writes FORMAT27. On first start it durably migrates supported
  FORMAT25 state, used by v0.1.28, to FORMAT27. The v0.1.28 package cannot read
  the resulting state.

## Upgrade and recovery

Before the first v0.1.31 start, stop the server and take a complete private
state backup. After any v0.1.31 write, returning to v0.1.28 requires stopping
the server, restoring that pre-start backup and then running v0.1.28. This loses
every write made since the backup and cannot undo external notifications,
bounces or agent deliveries. Restore success is unproved and has not been
tested; no recovery success is guaranteed. See `SELF_HOST.md` for the detailed
installer behavior and recovery limits.
